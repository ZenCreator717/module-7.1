     <h1> <center> ADVANCING COMPUTER SCIENCE

        The craft of programming transcends individual programming languages and emphasizes design across multiple scales, from 
      individual programs to complex multi-platform software architectures, including mobile platforms, multiple frameworks and 
      multiple design patterns. The Advancing Computer Science (ACS) degree balances the science of computing and the art of 
      design with the application of these principles to real-world problems. Graduates of the ACS major will be prepared for 
      software development positions where an understanding of algorithms and complex software design is important, in addition 
      to being well-versed in mobile, frameworks and multiple programming languages and environments. The Classification of 
      Instructional Programs (CIP) code for Advancing Computer Science is 11.0701
